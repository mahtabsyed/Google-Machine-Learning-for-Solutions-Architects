    "In various chapters, we discuss the importance of the the [least privilege](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/using-iam-securely#least_privilege) security principle, and we highlight specific [IAM roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview) that need to be assigned for particular activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to simplify the testing process in the various examples provided in this repository, the examples assume you are running them in a Vertex AI Workbench Notebook Instance that has been assigned the Google Cloud [Compute Engine default service account](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts#default_service_account) (the instructions in the book for setting up the Vertex AI Workbench Notebook Instance include the steps to do this).\n",
    "\n",
    "The prerequisite steps here ensure that the Compute Engine default service account is assigned the relevant roles to perform all activities in the example notebooks in this repository."
