    "\n",
    "In both the \"<=50K\" category, and the \">50K\" category, we see that the data contains many more data points for White people than any other race. This can be seen as a type of bias in the dataset. This bias may exist for multiple potential reasons, such as bias in the collection of the data, or it may happen due to other factors such as geographic location. For example, this particular dataset represents the population of a specific area, which may somewhat explain its apparent bias towards a particular race. For example, if the data were collected in Asia then it would contain many more data points for Asian people than any other race, or if it were collected in central Africa then it would contain many more data points for Black people than any other race. It's important to note any imbalances in the data and determine how they may affect the training of a machine learning model. \n",

    " - feature_names=X.columns.tolist(): The names of the features in the dataset, which help in making the explanation human-readable.\n",
    " - class_names=['<=50K', '>50K']: The names of the classes that the model is predicting. In this case, it's a binary classification problem with two possible outcomes: whether someone makes less than or equal to $50K, or more than $50K annually.\n",

The method clf.predict_proba is passed to the explainer, which is a function that the classifier clf uses to predict probabilities for the input data. The parameter num_features=10 tells the explainer to only use the top 10 features that are most influential for this particular prediction.\n",
    "6. Displaying the explanation: The visualization will show the features that influenced the model's prediction for the selected test instance, along with their relative importance and contribution to the prediction."
